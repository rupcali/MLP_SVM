# MLP and SVM Implementation

This project explores and implements machine learning algorithms, specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for classification tasks. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance using Python and essential data science libraries.

## Features
- Implementation of MLP and SVM from scratch and using popular libraries.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and visualization.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Integration with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- Python (>=3.7)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyterlab` (if you plan to run the notebook)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook mlp_svm.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Train and evaluate models.
   - Visualize results.

## Project Structure
- `mlp_svm.ipynb`: The primary notebook containing the implementation.
- `data/`: (Optional) Directory for datasets used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Results
The notebook includes model performance visualizations, such as confusion matrices and learning curves, to compare the effectiveness of MLP and SVM.
